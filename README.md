🏨 Hotel Industry Performance Dashboard
This project features a comprehensive and interactive performance dashboard developed in Power BI, focused on key operational and financial metrics within the Hotel Industry. The goal of this analysis is to provide hotel management and stakeholders with clear, actionable business intelligence to optimize revenue, improve occupancy, and streamline operations.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Primary Tool: Microsoft Power BI Desktop (.pbix file included).

Data Source: Simulated/Anonymized Hotel Operational and Financial Data (Likely includes booking, revenue, room type, and customer data).

Concepts Used: Data Modeling, DAX formulas (Calculated Measures and Columns), Advanced Visualization Techniques.

📊 Dashboard Features & Key Metrics
The dashboard is structured to provide a detailed view of hotel performance, tracking industry-standard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Revenue Management: Analysis of Total Revenue, Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Average Daily Rate (ADR).

Occupancy & Utilization: Tracking Occupancy Rate, Total Rooms Booked, and Cancellation Rates.

Customer & Booking Insights: Visualization of booking trends over time, segmentation of revenue by Room Type, and analysis of Lead Time.

Financial Health: Monitoring Net Profit, identifying high-cost areas, and benchmarking profitability across different segments (e.g., corporate vs. leisure).

Time Series Analysis: Trends showing daily, weekly, or monthly performance to identify seasonality and forecast demand.

💡 Key Findings and Business Insights
(This section is crucial for a data analyst portfolio! You must replace these placeholders with 2-3 specific, data-driven insights you found in the dashboard.)

[Example Insight 1 - RevPAR/ADR]: The Average Daily Rate (ADR) consistently dips during the months of January and February, indicating a strategic opportunity to boost off-season revenue through package deals or targeted marketing.

[Example Insight 2 - Occupancy]: Cancellations account for 15% of all bookings, with the highest rate coming from Online Travel Agencies (OTAs). Implementing a stricter deposit policy for OTA bookings could significantly improve net occupancy.

[Example Insight 3 - Room Type]: While Deluxe Suites generate the highest individual revenue, Standard Rooms contribute the highest volume of total profit due to their high occupancy rate and lower operational costs.
